Coverage and Black Library Usage

coverage - https://pypi.org/project/coverage/
Run all tests in a project:
coverage run --source /Users/tross/repos/codex-local/codex -m unittest discover
Run all tests in a specific test suite file
coverage run --source /Users/tross/repos/codex-local/codex -m unittest codex.module.submodule.tests.test_file
Run a specific test case
coverage run --source /Users/tross/repos/codex-local/codex -m unittest codex.module.submodule.tests.test_file.TestClass.test_case_method
The --source is so it doesn't look for tests on all the modules in the project, like pandas, without this out coverage would look like 2%, but you'll need to change that location
Formatters:
black https://pypi.org/project/black/
isort https://pypi.org/project/isort/
You can setup vscode to run these on save (my settings file below), but you can also just call them from a command line:
black codex/data_objects/travel_advisory_score.py
isort codex/data_objects/travel_advisory_score.py
In general I run black before isort
Linter:
There are lots, you can choose whichever one you like, I use pylint and it's not annoying which is the worst thing about linters
https://pypi.org/project/pylint/
Interactive shell
ipython https://pypi.org/project/ipython/
You might already have it via Jupyter, but it's good to know how to use it from a terminal, look up the magic methods for ipython when you have time, there's stuff like save all lines to a python script
pdb docs https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pdb.html
My project vscode settings
{
    "python.pythonPath": "/Users/tross/repos/codex-local/bin/python",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": false,
    "[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
        }
    }
}
The bit about
    "[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
is smart enough to use isort if it's installed
If you have issues with black and isort trying to format the same thing, create a file called .isort.cfg in the project root directory and add the following to it:
[settings]
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = True
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = True
ensure_newline_before_comments = True
line_length = 88
That should stop them from fighting with each other
